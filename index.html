                                    <p>Hello! My name is Christopher Frye and I am pursuing my Master of Science in Information Science, specializing in Human Centered Computing. I am from Voorhees, New Jersey and I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I am currently conducting research on immigrant college students and depression with relation to social media. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        During my time four years at Pitt and being a Resident Assistant, I know how to connect students with the best food spots, entertainment centers, and collegiate networking events. Pittsburgh is a fantastic city with plenty of diverse opportunities for students to pursue their dreams and enjoy collegiate experience. I am grateful to be able to serve fellow School of Computing and Information students on enrollment, classes, and professors. Feel free to contact me with any questions about the School of Computing and Information or about Pittsburgh itself!

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Biying and I am currently an undergraduate Junior. I’m working toward a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Studio Arts and also minoring in Japanese. I currently work for the School of Computing and Information and I am glad to be a student ambassador! Outside of the classroom, I am a member of the Panther Equestrian club. <br><br>My hometown is Beijing, China and I chose Pitt because Pitt offers such a wide variety of high-quality programs plus there is so much to explore around the city. I have learned so much by organizing and attending school events and I am more than happy to share with you my working and studying experience. Please do not hesitate to email me!

                                    <p>Hello! My name is Merline Paul and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Information Science. This program is the perfect fit for me, as it offers a variety of courses that capture the essence of what I would like to pursue in my career. I also recently graduated in Spring 2017 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.<br><br>
                                        I grew up in the Pittsburgh area, about 25 minutes away from the city. During my undergraduate career, I served as a Senior Affairs Officer for the American Chemical Society, researcher in a computational chemistry lab, and a teaching assistant for upper-level chemistry labs. These experiences helped me strengthen my communication and interpersonal skills. <br><br> 
                                        The University of Pittsburgh has a lot of opportunities to offer; career-wise as well as extracurricular. Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding the School of Computing and Information or Pittsburgh in general! <br><br>

                                    <p>Hi All, I am Kuheli. Born and brought up in The City of Joy- Kolkata, I moved to Pittsburgh to acquire cutting-edge research experiences. I earned my engineering bachelor’s and master’s from India. I also worked there for a year as a Software Engineer. Currently, I am pursuing Ph.D. from School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh where my research broadly focuses on Distributed Computer Systems. I find Pittsburgh to be a vibrant city with friendly neighborhood. Additionally, University of Pittsburgh is a very good research institute with lots of good opportunities. <br><br>
                                        If you have any question regarding the graduate program, more specifically on the Ph.D. program in SCI at Pitt, feel free to contact me. In fact, if you are undergraduate or graduate student, who seek any career guidance, broader perspective on Ph.D. life and beyond or any career-mentoring, I will be happy to meet, discuss and share a different perspective on my acquired experiences with you.<br><br>
                                        I am looking forward to meeting you and have a pleasant discussion.
                                        <br><br>

                                    <p>I am currently a PhD Candidate in the School of Computing and Information, after receiving my MST degree from the same school. After spending 2 years here getting my Master’s degree, I decided to stick around for another 4 years or so pursuing a PhD, because it is a great nurturing, encouraging and inspiring environment to work in.<br>
                                        I personally find Pittsburgh to be a fantastic, growing, diverse city that is on the cusp of the great innovations of our time. Opportunities are aplenty and there is a spirit of experimentation and entrepreneurship that is very refreshing.<br>
                                        I'd be happy to help anyone get acquainted with the ample resources available for you to make a smooth transition into life and academics in Pittsburgh.<br><br>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>I'm a senior, planning to graduate in spring 2019 with three bachelor's degrees in Computer Science, Information Science, and Philosophy. Primarily, I am interested in studying video games, from their effectiveness as educational technology to their impact as pieces of art. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I am a BPhil candidate through the University Honor's College with a research project in gamification. Working with a neuroscience lab on campus, I developed a web-application to teach low-income parents about brain development through short games; my BPhil project is centered around measuring the effectiveness of gamification strategies I designed for the application. I also work as an application developer in a research lab in the History and Philosophy of Science department interested in the historical representation of women in philosophy.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In addition to that research, I am also working with a few student teams on various major video game development projects, including a 'Pokemon: Go'-style location-based augmented reality game for parents to play with their kids, an interactive fiction project I'm developing with English graduate students, and an experimental feminist philosophy game that analyzes arguments around the #metoo movement. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    My interests and work in games pushed me to found 'games-edu', a student organization centered on connecting students and faculty to develop educational and transformational games across various disciplines. My goal, both in this organization and in my prospective career, is to research and develop games that improve people's lives, teach them things, and encourage conversations on social justice.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Outside of my academic work, I also find time to sing bass in the Pitt Men's Glee Club and Pantherhythms. In my free time, I take advantage of Pittsburgh's excellent public transportation (free with a Pitt ID!) to explore the cultural district, check out the newest groundbreaking museum exhibits, and continue my search for the city's best pulled-pork sandwich.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I’m extremely thankful for all of the opportunities Pitt has given me over the past few years and I love talking about them with anyone who asks! Feel free to reach out!<br><br>

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Gwyn and I am a current Senior in the school of Computing and Information. I am working towards a BS in Information Science with a concentration in Information Systems, a related area in Business Information Systems, and a minor in Economics. I chose Pitt because I love the city and was interested in exploring all the programs the School of Computing and Information offers.<br><br>
                                        In my free time I like to get involved in as many activities I can on campus and around the city. This past year I have become a facilitator for the Girls Who Code Pittsburgh chapter and the Scholarship Chair for the Kappa Theta Pi Professional Technology Fraternity. Outside of school, I love to explore the different neighborhoods of Pittsburgh and take advantage of the all activities for students around the city. Feel free to contact me about any questions you have about the school or Pittsburgh! I am happy to help in any way I can. <br><br>

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Herminio Bodon from Puerto Rico. I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Information Sciences at the School of Computing and Information (SCI) at Pitt. I have selected the SCI because of its culture of collaboration between fields, and efforts to help marginalized communities. An effort that I feel particularly strong about. I earned a B.S. in Liberal Studies, and minors in English and Business Administration from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico.
                                     <br><br>
                                    I am a Commonwealth Scholar at the SCI working on community outreach efforts in the Pittsburgh area, and organizing social events within the school. In addition, I am an 2018 i3 Scholar doing research in Spatial Cognition, and ML techniques.
                                     <br><br>
                                    From “La Isla del Encanto” I enjoy outdoors, sports, and Hispanic food & music. I am passionate about helping people get access to opportunities and reach their full potential. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to learn more about the opportunities available to you as a Pitt student.<br><br>

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Mark Babatunde and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science. I am currently involved with most of Pitt's Hackathons, including Steelhacks, SheInnovates, and Hack 4 Humanity. I'm also doing a web development internship this fall at Orange Arrow under the directions of Pitt professors.
                                        <br><br>

                                        Outside of hackathons, I'm a member of Pitt's CS club, the Women in Computer Science club, and the National Society of Black Engineers. In my free time, I love learning more about frontend web development, such as the Vue.js and React.js frameworks.  Pitt is a fantastic school for Computer Science with an ample amount of resources, research opportunities, and activities to participate in. Please feel free to contact me about Pitt, the CS program, or just Pittsburgh in general!

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Frank Pasqualini and I am a Sophomore at Pitt.  I am working towards a dual degree in Computer Science and Statistics and a minor in Music.  I have not yet decided what my CS concentration will be, but I'm leaning towards Data Science, AI, Software Engineering, or possibly making my own concentration.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I have been programming since Freshman year of high school, and coding is one of my passions.  I try to make the most of my free time by going to clubs like the Computer Science Club or the Information Security Club to hone my skills and gain more experience.  I often participate in Hackathons or work on little side projects just for the fun of it.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I intend to make the most out of my remaining time at Pitt by taking as many classes as I can each semester and focusing on my career by attending internship fairs and networking events.  If you have any questions about the CS curriculum or you need help planning your courses or career, don’t hesitate to ask me.

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Margaret Palko, and I am currently a sophomore working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Information Science with a concentration in Data Analytics and IT Consulting. Ultimately, I am interested in being a consultant, and Information Science has given me the tools to bridge the gap between technology and people.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I grew up outside of Philadelphia, but more specifically, the King of Prussia Area. Being in Pittsburgh has allowed me to explore a completely new city, and I love all of the art festivals that occur throughout the year. Pittsburgh is home to some big technology companies such as Duolingo, BNY Mellon, and more, so I have found that the opportunities are endless. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Outside of being a student, I am a Pitt Pathfinder for the University which means I give tours to prospective students. In addition, I am a Resident Assistant, and I am also a Recruitment Intern for the School of Computing and Information where I work 1:1 with the Enrollment Manager. Lastly, I am a project manager for the Incline Consulting Group; ICG works with local non-profits around Pittsburgh, and we do pro-bono consulting work for them. These positions have given me the amazing opportunity to work with so many individuals while gaining many lifelong skills.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Altogether, if you don't catch me in class or my activities, I am normally running, doing yoga, or reading novels. If you have any questions about my activities, major, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me!

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Meera, and I’m currently in my Senior year working toward a degree under the User Centered Design focus of Information Science. I’m interested in the front end design aspect of web development and have been recently working with graphic design and animations.<br><br>

                                        I grew up in rural New Jersey, so coming to Pittsburgh has been an experience of broadening horizons. The city is culturally vibrant, and well on its way to becoming the tech hub of the Northeast. It’s quite an exciting thing to be living here and studying in a STEM field while this industry advances so quickly.<br><br>

                                        Outside of the classroom I’m a facilitator at Girls Who Code,  teaching girls at a local high school about empowerment as well as technical coding skills. I am also a member of a co-ed professional technology fraternity Kappa Theta Pi, where I serve on the executive board as Technology Chair (working to develop our online presence, and website). Other than technology related extra-curriculars, I am a project manager at our University’s first studio of Design For America; a community outreach and social entrepreneurship organization. Getting involved so extensively at Pitt has been an easy and rewarding experience.<br><br>

                                        I am an avid photographer as well, and love to explore Pittsburgh’s hundreds of neighborhoods. I’d be more than happy to share about my experiences with you (inside and outside the classroom), I look forward to hearing from you!<br><br>

                                    <p>Hello. My name is Coleton Bryan and I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh. Currently I am working towards earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science along with a certificate in Digital Media. In terms of career paths, ideally I would like to work as a technical consultant. It is a field that would allow me to combine my passion for helping people work with technology. Eventually, I think it would be really cool to work as a videogame developer, but that will probably just be a side job/hobby.

                                    I’m from east PA, an hour north of Philly in the Bucks County area. Growing up in the suburbs made me think I would never be a city person. But after visiting the campus I was surprised that it was a contained, separate from the city. Pitt gives me easy access to all the city has to offer without the intimidating city lifestyle. Living here the past 2 years has been a great experience and has really made me fall in love with the city.

                                    Outside the classroom I am a Pitt Pathfinder for the University. Basically I give tours to prospective students and help run any recruitment programs that we host throughout the year. I am also involved with the Business Technology Association. BTA is club designed to provide students with speakers from various companies throughout Pittsburgh. These speakers are sometimes Pitt alum, and they simply come at talk about the journey from a college student to the work force. We also hold workshops that focus on developing professional skills such as interviewing and resume building. It is also a great space for developing hackathon teams. Finally, I work part time for the university as a student technical help desk consultant. I essentially work a remote technical support for students who have issues with Pitt related tech/software.

                                    My experience with customer service and tech support has given me a passion for helping people understand technology. It is a shame that many people feel as though technology is out of their reach; something they will never understand. Similarly, I love talking to prospective students and answering whatever questions they may have. Feel free to reach out with any you may have, whether it be about the university in general, the computer science program, or even my own personal experiences!

                                    <p>Hey, there! I am Ainur, graduate student pursuing Master of Science in Information Science. I chose this program for its flexible curriculum which allows students to get the taste from different specializations in IS. Before starting the graduate program, I was not certain about the future area of focus. After mixing and matching some courses from different specializations of the program, I chose my future area of specialization - Data Analytics. Currently I am working in the cybersecurity lab at SCI. <br><br>

                                    I was born and raised in Kazakhstan. I graduated with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Kazakh-British Technical University. <br><br>

                                    Moreover, I am the president of student organization called Data Dojo where we practice the skills learnt from the courses and develop cool applications.

                                    <p>Hello! My name is Zara Blum, and I'm a Master's candidate in the Information Science program, focusing in the Human-Centered Computing track. This program was the perfect fit for me as it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how information technology systems work while still being flexible enough to explore my own path. With this freedom, I've gained deeper insight into AI/ML and Cyber Law/Ethics specifically.
                                        <br><br>

                                    I'm originally from Rhode Island, and I moved to Pittsburgh after graduating from the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelor's in Mathematics and minors in Anthropology, Computer Science, and Philosophy. Needless to say, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do. I worked full time at CMU for a few years in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department while getting a Master's in Strategic Public Relations, and ultimately ended up at Pitt because the program really allowed me to tailor my interests while figuring them out once I knew I wanted a more technical career.

                                        <br><br>

                                    Pitt SCI has been my door to so many great opportunities. I'm currently performing research for two projects under different faculty (reccomender and decision systems), volunteering in the Cyren Cybersecurity lab, and working as a course developer. Previously I've gotten to work on projects through class and the iServes program which have allowed me to connect with the local Pittsburgh community, learning skills in UX research while applying them to real problems. I was also lucky enough to represent Pitt with a handful of other students at the Grace Hopper Women in Computing Conference! All of these amazing experiences have helped me build not only my skills, but also my confidence, and that has led me get a full time job at Facebook for after I graduate! 

                                        <br><br>

                                    I am so thankful for my time at Pitt. Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions, I'd be more than happy to help!
